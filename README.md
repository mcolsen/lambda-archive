# lambda-archive

An archive of assignments from my time as a student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). Each assignment was previously hosted in its own repository, cluttering my GitHub profile and making it difficult to find what I'm currently working on. They're now hosted here in a single repository, organized by unit and sprint.

## What's archived here

- Module projects (daily assignments)
- Sprint challenges (weekly assessments)
